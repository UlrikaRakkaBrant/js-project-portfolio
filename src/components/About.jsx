        I'm a web developer with a passion for blending creativity and technology. I create
        engaging, user-friendly websites that focus on both functionality and design. My
        background in theatre gives me a unique perspective, bringing storytelling and
        visual creativity into every project. Iâ€™m driven by the idea of making digital
        experiences that are as immersive and impactful as a great performance.
