# 🌟 Ulrika Einebrant – Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio built with **React**, designed to showcase my web projects, skills, and creative work — including my theatre group, [Kompani Error](https://kompanierror.se/#/).  

It’s built mobile-first and fully responsive across devices, following my custom design in Figma.
